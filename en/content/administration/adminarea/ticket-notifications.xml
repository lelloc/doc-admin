    <title>Ticket Notifications</title>

    <para>
        OTRS allows ticket notifications to be sent to agents and customers, based on the occurrence of certain events.
        Agents can customize their ticket notification settings via the <link linkend="user-preferences">preferences</link> link.
    </para>

    <para>
        Through the "Ticket Notifications" link on the Admin page, you can manage the ticket notifications of your system (see figure below).
        OTRS comes with a set of predefined notifications that cover a wide range of use cases.

    </para>

    <para>
        You can edit the basic data of this notification such as name and comment, and control if the agents may choose
        to receive this notification (per transport method). For every language, a subject and body can be added/edited
        to configure what will actually be sent as the notification content.
    </para>

    <para>
        Just as with signatures and salutations, it is possible to dynamically create the content of a notification
        by using special variables. You can find a list of variables at the bottom of the screen.
    </para>

    <para>
        You can choose which events should trigger this notification, and limit it to tickets which match certain criteria
        (ticket and/or article filter). This makes it possible to create different notifications for different queues, priorities
        or other criteria that might be relevant for your system.
    </para>

    <para>
        The recipients of the notification can be configured according to different criteria (groups, roles, individual agents etc.).
        All configured recipients will receive the notification.
    </para>

    </para>

    <para>
        Additionally, you can specify if the notification should be sent to agents who are out of office, and limit the
        sending to once per day and ticket (e. g. pending reminder notification).
    </para>

    <para>
        Notifications can be sent with different notification methods. The "Email" notification method is available in OTRS Free,
        with <emphasis role="bold">OTRS Business Solution™</emphasis> you also get the possibility to store and view
        the notifications in the database (so that no email client is needed to use OTRS) as well as to send them via
        SMS (e. g. for very important notifications).
    </para>

    <para>
        The field 'Additional recipient email addresses' provides the possibility to use OTRS-tags like &lt;OTRS_TICKET_DynamicField_...&gt; to insert values from the current ticket.
        The according SMS field (only available in <emphasis role="bold">OTRS Business Solution™</emphasis>) also has this feature.
    </para>
    <para>
        Since OTRS 5S Email transport contains security options for each notification, that includes signing and encrypting
        possibilities with PGP and S/MIME and the opportunity to decide what to do in case of missing key or certificate.
