        OTRS has an extensible reporting mechanism that allows to define a customized operational statistics and
        generate custom reports associated with OTRS usage. The OTRS system uses the term "statistic" generically to
        refer to a single report presenting various indicators, while "report" refers to a collection of several
        statistics in one PDF document that can be easily configured and automatically generated and distributed.

            Proper configuration of the OTRS statistics module is associated with a multitude of requirements and
            considerations. These include the various OTRS modules to be evaluated, user permission settings, indicators
            to be calculated and their complexity levels, ease of configuration of the statistics module, speed and
            efficiency of calculations, and support of a rich set of output variants.

            Statistical elements, i.e. files which supplement the functionality of the statistics module for specific
            requirements, can be integrated for calculating complex statistics.

                "Statistics" in the main menu.

                    Selecting the "Statistics" link in the navigation bar, and then the sub-menu link "Statistics",
                    calls up the Overview screen. The Overview screen presents a list of all pre-configured reports an
                    agent can use (see figure below).

                    When the statistics module is installed, it comes preloaded with a few sample statistics imported
                    into the system. These are shown as a list on the overview page. If the overview list extends to
                    more than a single page, the agent can browse through the different pages. The list of statistics
                    can be sorted as desired, by clicking the desired column header in the list. To generate a
                    particular statistic, click on the statistic's "Run now" link.

                    Agents with write rights can edit an existing report configuration by calling up the edit screen of
                    the statistics module. Alternately, they may create a new report.

                    There are four possible steps in the configuration of a statistic: the general specification data,
                    configuring the x-axis, y-axis and possible data filters for the reported data (or restrictions).
                    Let's create a new statistic as an example by clicking the "Add" button in the overview screen. Our
                    goal will be to get an overview of how many tickets with very high priority are in every queue
                    (x-axis) and state (y-axis).

                <para>
                    At the beginning we have to select the type of statistic we want to add. Three types are available:
                </para>
                <para>
                    <variablelist>
                        <varlistentry>

                                <para>
                                    This type of statistics will generate a matrix of computed values (e.g. new tickets
                                    per day of month and queue). All value cells in the matrix have the same type
                                    (number, average time, etc). Values are computed from entities in the system (e.g.
                                    tickets). Some matrix statistics support a summation column and/or row (only useful
                                    for certain data).
                                </para>

                                    This kind of statistic will generate a table where every line (not cell) represents
                                    an entity in the system (e.g. a ticket). The columns in this row are usually
                                    configurable (x-axis, see below) and contain the data of this object (e.g. ticket
                                    attributes). All value cells in one column have the same type.
                                </para>

                                    This kind of statistic is not very much configurable and usually used for very
                                    special and/or complex computations.
                                </para>

                </para>
                <para>
                    So let's select "Dynamic Matrix" for our example. Then the "General Specifications" configuration
                    will appear below the statistic type selection.

                <para>
                    After providing a title and description for the new statistic, we have to select the statistics
                    backend that we want to use. This is the actual backend module which is responsible to collect and
                    analyze the data for our statistic. In our case we'll select "TicketAccumulation".
                </para>
                <para>
                    By configuring permission groups, we can facilitate a restriction of the groups (and therefore,
                    agents) who can later view and generate the pre-configured statistics. Thus the various statistics
                    can be allocated to the different departments and work groups who need them. It is possible to
                    allocate one statistic to various groups.

                            The "stats" group was selected. The report is viewable for all users having at least RO
                            rights for the "stats" group. This access is available by default.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            A group named "sales" was selected. All users with RO rights for the "sales" group can see
                            the stat in the view mode and generate it. However, the statistic will not be available for
                            viewing by other users.
                        </para>

                </para>
                <para>
                    Additionally, possible output formats can be selected. Here we can just keep all output formats and
                    choose the one to use when actually generating the statistic. Let's save the statistic now.
                </para>
                <para>
                    The next screen will indicate the next step with a highlighted button: we should configure the
                    x-axis. By clicking the button, a dialog will appear where we can select the element to be used for
                    the x-axis. In our case that will be the queue:

                <para>
                    We can optionally limit the queues to be shown by selecting some in the queue field. With the
                    checkbox we can control if the agent who generates the statistic can make changes to the queue
                    selection. We'll keep the defaults and press "Save".
                </para>
                <para>
                    Now we can configure the y-axis in the same way: select the state field.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Here it is possible to select one element or two. In the first case, every value of the element will
                    be one element on the y-axis. If two elements are selected, their permutations will be the elements
                    on the value series. For example you could select "state" and "priority", and the resulting elements
                    will be "new - 1 very low", "new - 2 low", ... "open - 1 very low" and so on. Let's just use the
                    state and press "Save".
                </para>
                <para>
                    Now in the last step we could add data filters to only include tickets belonging to a certain
                    customer, with certain priorities and so on. We'll add a filter for very high priority tickets:
