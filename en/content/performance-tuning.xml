            <title>TicketIndexModule</title>
            <para>
                There are two backend modules for the index for the ticket queue view:

                        <para>
                            This is the default option, and will generate each queue view on the fly from the ticket
                            table. You will not have performance trouble until you have about 60,000 open tickets in
                            your system.

                        <para>
                            The most powerful module, should be used when you have above 80,000 open tickets. It
                            uses an extra <literal>ticket_index</literal> table, which will be populated with
                            keywords based on ticket data. Use
                            <filename>bin/otrs.Console.pl Maint::Ticket::QueueIndexRebuild</filename> for generating
                            an initial index after switching backends.

            <title>Ticket Search Index</title>
            <para>
                OTRS uses a special search index to perform full-text searches across fields in articles from different
                communication channels.
            </para>
            <para>
                To create an initial index, use
                <filename>bin/otrs.Console.pl Maint::Ticket::FulltextIndex --rebuild</filename>.
            </para>
            <note>
                <para>
                    Actual article indexing happens via an OTRS daemon job in the background. While articles which were
                    just added in the system are marked for indexing immediately, it could happen their index is
                    available within a few minutes.

                There are some options available for fine tuning the search index:

                            Defines if archived tickets will be included in the search index (off by default). This is
                            advisable to keep the index small on large systems with archived tickets. If this is turned
                            off, archived tickets will not be found by full-text searches.

                            The attribute <literal>WordCountMax</literal> defines the maximum number of words which will
                            be processed to build up the index. For example only the first 1000 words of an article body
                            are stored in the article search index. The attributes <literal>WordLengthMin</literal> and
                            <literal>WordLengthMax</literal> are used as word length boundaries. Only words with a
                            length between these two values are stored in the article search index.

                            There are three default filters defined:

                                    The third filter strips out words which do not contain a word-character:

                            There are so-called stop-words defined for some languages. These stop-words will be skipped
                            while creating the search index.

                    <filename>bin/otrs.Console.pl Admin::Article::StorageSwitch</filename> to put the articles from the
                    database onto the filesystem or the other way around. You can use the <emphasis>--target</emphasis>
                    option to specify the target backend. Please note that the entire process can take considerable time
                    to run, depending on the number of articles you have and the available CPU power and/or network

            <title>Archiving Tickets</title>

            <para>
                As OTRS can be used as an audit-proof system, deleting closed tickets may not be a good idea. Therefore
                we implemented a feature that allows you to archive tickets.
            </para>
            <para>
                Tickets that match certain criteria can be marked as "archived". These tickets are not accessed if you
                do a regular ticket search or run a Generic Agent job. The system itself does not have to deal with a
                huge amount of tickets any longer as only the "latest" tickets are taken into consideration when using
                OTRS. This can result in a huge performance gain on large systems.
            </para>
            <para>
                To use the archive feature simply follow these steps:

                    <para>
                        In the Admin page, go to SysConfig and select the group <literal>Ticket</literal>. In
                        <literal>Core::Ticket</literal> you find the option <literal>Ticket::ArchiveSystem</literal>
                        which is set to "no" by default. Change this setting to "yes" and save this change.

                                    The ticket filter is searches for tickets that match the selected criteria. It might
                                    be a good idea to only archive those tickets in a closed state that have been closed
                                    a few months before.

    <section id="performance-tuning-webserver">
        <title>Webserver</title>
        <para>
            Of course you should use mod_perl 2.0 (
            <ulink url="http://perl.apache.org/">
                <citetitle>http://perl.apache.org/</citetitle>

            ). It's much
            faster (~ *100) than pure CGI, but it needs more RAM.

        <section id="performance-tuning-webserver-db">
            <title>Pre-established database connections</title>
            <para>
                You can have the database connections pre-established on startup of the web server. This saves time (see
                <filename>README.webserver</filename>).

        <section id="performance-tuning-webserver-startup">
            <title>Preloaded modules - startup.pl</title>
            <para>
                Use the startup script <filename>scripts/apache2-perl-startup.pl</filename> for preloaded/precompiled
                Perl modules on your mod_perl webserver to be faster, with a smaller memory footprint (see

        <section id="performance-tuning-webserver-reload">
            <title>Reload Perl modules when updated on disk</title>
            <para>
                By default Apache::Reload is used in <filename>scripts/apache2-httpd.include.conf</filename>. Disable it
                and you will get 8% more speed. But remember to restart the web server if you install any modules via
                the OTRS Package Manager, or any values in your SysConfig or in <filename>Kernel/Config.pm</filename>.

                If you have a larger installation, e.g. over 1,000 new tickets per day and over 40 agents, it is a good
                idea to read the chapters on Performance of the mod_perl User's Guide (
                <ulink url="http://perl.apache.org/docs/2.0/user/index.html">
                    <citetitle>http://perl.apache.org/docs/2.0/user/index.html</citetitle>

        <section id="performance-tuning-webserver-gzip">
            <title>mod_gzip/mod_deflate</title>
            <para>
                If your bandwidth is small, use <literal>mod_deflate</literal> for Apache2. If you have an html page
                with 45k, <literal>mod_gzip</literal>/<literal>mod_deflate</literal> compresses it to about 7k. The
                drawback is that this increases the load on the server side.
