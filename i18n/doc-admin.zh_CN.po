"A trouble ticket is similar to a medical report created for a hospital "

"an answer is sent back to the customer, or if the ticket is separately "
"closed by the system. If a customer responds again on an already closed "
"ticket, the ticket is reopened with the new information added. Every ticket "
"is stored and archived with complete information. Since tickets are handled "
"like normal emails, attachments and contextual annotations will also be "
"stored with each email. In addition, information on relevant dates, "

"A useful filter rule would be to let OTRS automatically move mails marked "
