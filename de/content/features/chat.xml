    <title>The Chat</title>

    <section>
        <title>Beschreibung</title>
        <para>
            The chat feature allows for chats between agents and customers using the
OTRS frontend. Once enabled, customers (or public users) can start chats
with agents and vice versa. Finished chats can be archived and attached to
tickets, or can be downloaded as PDF by agents, customers and public users.
        </para>
        <para>
            Each chat is assigned to a chat channel. Chat channels are like chat
rooms. Each chat channel is assigned to a certain group which controls the
permissions for this channel. If no chat channel is selected when a chat is
created, this chat will be created in a default channel (which is
automatically created if it doesn't exist).
        </para>

        <para>
            The following system configuration options are relevant for this

system configuration (<literal>Core::Chat</literal>).

                        To start a chat with another agent, you can use the user on-line widget from
the dashboard. Agents who are able to use the chat, will have a chat icon

open which you can use to enter your first chat message to this agent. After
the chat request has been sent to the other agent, you can watch the chat in

                If there is a new chat request in one of the channels you (as an agent) have
permissions for, you'll receive a browser notification which allows you to
go directly to the chat manager. After you've opened the chat manager, you
can see a list of open requests of all types (see figure below).

details of the request. Clicking the button will open an overlay which
provides several actions on this request. Given that you've got sufficient
permissions, you can accept the request or change the channel for this
request. Changing the channel will follow the same rules as creating new
request: you can only move the request to a channel which has active agents
in it.
            </para>
            <para>
                Changing the chat channel without accepting the request could be used to
dispatch chats to the right department for example.

                To send messages, you can use the text field in the chat widget in your list
of active chats. Once you are done with typing your message, submit it by
either clicking the send icon next to the text field, or using tab and enter
(consecutively). When the message has been sent, the cursor will jump back
to the text field to allow for easily continuing to type.

                        From the chat widget head top right hand side, you can close the chat by
clicking the "x" icon. Clicking the circle icon right next to the close
icon, allows you to set up a personal monitoring for this chat, which is
again a three-way switch (no monitoring = empty circle, only monitor
customer activity = empty circle with tick icon, monitor all actions =
filled circle with tick icon). When monitoring a chat, browser notifications
will show up each time there is a new action in this chat.

have been invited to. If you join the chat as observer, you will only be
able to read what others are contributing to the chat and you will be
invisible to customers or public users. Agents will still receive a message
that you joined the chat as observer. As an observer, you have the
possibility to become a participant anytime by using the advanced action

                    Using the <emphasis>Preview</emphasis> tab you can see the chat widget in
action. In the browser simulator below, you can see the chat widget look
based on current configuration.

                        Please note that the preview uses the real chat module. If the chat widget
doesn't show up after the configured amount of time, there are probably no
agents available for chatting and you have configured the chat shouldn't
show up in this case.

                            If you cannot see the chat widget, but everything seems in order, make sure
you have at least one agent who is externally available for chat. Or switch
on the <emphasis>Display Chat if no agent is available</emphasis> option in
the <emphasis>Configuration</emphasis> tab, and refresh the code.

                            If you get mixed-content warnings in your browser console, make sure that
OTRS configuration option <literal>HttpType</literal> is properly set. For
example, if you are running OTRS on SSL, this configuration option must be
set to <literal>https</literal>. Your website must run on the same protocol
for chat widget to work.

make sure that <emphasis>jQuery</emphasis> library is included in your web
page, and that chat related code is placed below it.
