<title>Systemkonfiguration</title>

<para>
The System Configuration link leads to the section where many OTRS
configuration options are maintained.
</para>

<para>
The system configuration link on the admin page loads the graphical user
interface for the system configuration (see figure below). You can upload
your own configuration files for the system, as well as backup all current
settings into a file. Almost all configuration parameters of the OTRS
framework and any installed extensions can be viewed and changed using this
interface. All configuration parameters are part of a certain group, which
makes it possible to navigate quickly through the vast number of existing
parameters. It is also possible to perform a full-text search over all
parameters.
