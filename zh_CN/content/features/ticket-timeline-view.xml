        <para>
            The ticket timeline view provides a chronological view of all actions which
happened on a ticket (which includes articles, owner changes, incoming
mails, etc). With the ticket timeline view, agents are able to get a good
overview of a ticket in less time.

            To access the ticket timeline view, use the gear icon in the top right
corner of the article widget in the ticket zoom screen. You will be
redirected to the timeline view and this view will be kept as a preference
until you change back to another view.

            In the ticket timeline view, you can work on the ticket as you're used
to. You can inspect the time of each event in the timeline by hovering the
little square next to each event with your mouse cursor. You can view the
full content of articles by using the zoom icon on top of the certain
articles box, where you will find all common article actions such as Reply,
Split, Forward, etc.
