Priorities
==========

Sometimes tickets are not equally created. One ticket may need more focus than another. A customer may be given a higher priority by the service desk to help raise customer satisfaction in a pinch or to ensure that a long-running request receives special attention. Keeping track of these higher priority requests is important, as well as handling them quickly.

OTRS provides a traffic light system based per default five levels of priorities to handle this task.

- Blue: very low
- Green: low
- Grey: normal
- Pink: high
- Red: very high

The colors are based on the ID (very low being ID 1) in the database. Changing the names should be done with this in mind. New priorities have the color gray.

Use this screen to add priorities to the system. A fresh OTRS installation contains five default priority levels. The priority management screen is available in the *Priorities* module of the *Ticket Settings* group.

.. warning::

   Priorities can not be deleted from the system. They can only be deactivated by setting the *Validity* option to *invalid* or *invalid-temporarily*.

.. note::

   It's recommended to limit your system to 5 priorities or less and reuse the current 5 to keep the use of the traffic light system.

To edit a priority:

1. Click on a priority in the list of priorities.
2. Modify the fields.
3. Click on the *Save* or *Save and finish* button.

   Priority Validation Dialog

If you change the name of a priority which is used in the system configuration, a validation check will warn you and give you the following options:

Save and update automatically
   Apply the change and also update the affected settings.

Don't save, update manually
   Apply the change, but don't update the affected settings. The updates need to be done manually.

Cancel
   Cancel the action.

.. warning::

   Changing the name of this object should be done with care, the check only provides verification for certain settings and ignores things where the name can't be verified. Some examples are dashboard filters, action control lists (ACLs), and processes (sequence flow actions) to name a few. Documentation of your setup is key to surviving a name change.
