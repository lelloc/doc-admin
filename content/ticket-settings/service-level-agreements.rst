Service Level Agreements
========================

Your organization must meet the time demands of your customers. Timely service matters. Response to questions, updates on issues, and solutions must be provided in an agreed amount of time. The agent must receive notification of possible breaches, to prevent ticket escalation.

OTRS scales well with your needs and offers management of service level agreements (SLAs). OTRS provides you with the possibility to create numerous service level agreements covering all of your service and customer need. Each :term:`SLA` can cover multiple services and define the availability of service and escalation periods.

Use this screen to add service level agreements to the system. A fresh OTRS installation doesn't contain any service level agreements by default. The service level agreement management screen is available in the *Service Level Agreements* module of the *Ticket Settings* group.

   To use this feature, :sysconfig:`Ticket::Service <core.html#ticket-service>` must be activated in the :doc:`../administration/system-configuration` under the *Administration* group to be selectable in the ticket screens. You may click on the link in the warning message of the notification bar to directly jump to the configuration setting.
