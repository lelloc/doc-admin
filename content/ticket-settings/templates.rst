Templates
=========

Providing the correct and consistent answer all the time regardless of employee or knowledge-level is important to maintain a professional appearance to your customers. Additionally, speed in sending standard answers is key to wading through the masses of requests in growing service desks.

OTRS templates offer you a variety of ways to deal with standardizing communications and help to pre-define texts so that the customer always receives the same level and quality of service from all agents.

Use this screen to add templates for use in communications. A fresh OTRS installation already contains a template by default. The template management screen is available in the *Templates* module of the *Ticket Settings* group.

   Template Variables

For example, the variable ``<OTRS_TICKET_TicketNumber>`` expands to the ticket number allowing a template to include something like the following.

.. code-block:: text

   Ticket#<OTRS_TICKET_TicketNumber>

This tag expands, for example to:

.. code-block:: text

   Ticket#2018101042000012
