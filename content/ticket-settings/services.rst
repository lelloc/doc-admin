Services
========

Requests to your service desk should be categorized based on affected :term:`service` to correctly reach a team of experts to deal with the issue. Because not all your agents can deal with specific problems. Lack of experience or access to resources to fix an issue requires defining the service affected in a ticket helps to categorize the issue and target the correct teams.

OTRS allows adding all services offered to your customers. These services may be later bound to :doc:`service-level-agreements` to ensure a timely solution based on customer-specific agreements.

Use this screen to add services to the system. A fresh OTRS installation doesn't contain any services by default. The service management screen is available in the *Services* module of the *Ticket Settings* group.

.. note::

   If several services are added to the system, use the filter box to find a particular service by just typing the name to filter.

.. warning::

   Changing the name of this object should be done with care, the check only provides verification for certain settings and ignores things where the name can't be verified. Some examples are dashboard filters, action control lists (ACLs), and processes (sequence flow actions) to name a few. Documentation of your setup is key to surviving a name change.
