Queues ↔ Auto Responses
=======================

Communicating a change in, for example, service times, service levels or other information which would be good for a customer to know when opening a ticket can be a tedious and error-ridden task. Attempting to make sure all departments have the correct information and transmitting this to their customers poses a challenge.

OTRS gives you the power to quickly assign the appropriate automatic responses to any queue, containing pertinent service information, ensuring this information reaches your customers before expectations aren't reached.

Use this screen to add one or more automatic responses to one or more queues. The management screen is available in the *Queues ↔ Auto Responses* module of the *Ticket Settings* group.

.. note::

   It is not possible to assign multiple queues to an automatic response by clicking on the automatic response name. A click on the automatic response will open to the :doc:`auto-responses` screen.

.. note::

   If several automatic responses or queues are added to the system, use the filter box to find a particular automatic response or queue by just typing the name to filter.


Queues ↔ Auto Responses Settings
--------------------------------

The following settings are available when assigning some automatic responses to a queue.

auto reply
   This automatic response will be sent to users, when they send a message to the queue, and the message is not a follow-up message of a ticket.

auto reject
   This automatic response will be sent to users, when they send a message to the queue and *reject* is set as *Follow up Option* in the queue settings.

auto follow up
   This automatic response will be sent to users, when they send a message to the queue and *possible* is set as *Follow up Option* in the queue settings.

auto reply/new ticket
   This automatic response will be sent to users, when they send a message to the queue and *new ticket* is set as *Follow up Option* in the queue settings.

auto remove
   This automatic response will be sent to users, when the remove option is enabled.

.. note::

   *Auto reply*, *auto reject* and *auto reply/new ticket* mutually cancel each other based on the :doc:`queues` settings. Only one will take effect per queue.
