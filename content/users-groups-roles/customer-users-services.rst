.. note::

   If several customer users or services are added to the system, use the search box to find a particular customer user or use the filter box to find a particular service by just typing the name to filter.

Multiple customer users or services can be assigned in both screens at the same time. Additionally clicking on a customer user or clicking on a service in the relations screen will open the *Edit Customer User* screen or the *Edit Service* screen accordingly.

.. warning::

   Accessing a customer user or a service provides no back link to the relations screen.

.. note::

   By setting a checkbox in the header of a column will set all the checkboxes in the selected column.


Manage Default Services
-----------------------

It is possible to add default services, so that all customer users may access them. This prevents having to add each service to each customer user.

To edit the default services:

1. Click on the *Edit default services* button in the left sidebar.
2. Select the services which should be selectable for all customer users.
3. Click on the *Save* or *Save and finish* button.

.. warning::

   Mixing default services and customer specific services can be confusing. If a customer user has specific services assigned, then the default services will be not applied.
