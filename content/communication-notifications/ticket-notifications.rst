Ticket Notifications
====================

Streamlining communication can save hours of labor and prevent mistakes. Sending certain messages at pre-defined stages of communication not only keeps the customer and agents informed about specific events, but it can also aid your agents by programmatically doing automated updates to the customer.

The flexible OTRS is an industry leader in email communication and offers you complete control of notifications based on any event in your system.

Use this screen to add ticket notifications to the system. In a fresh OTRS installation several ticket notifications are already added by default. The ticket notification management screen is available in the *Ticket Notifications* module of the *Communication & Notifications* group.

Ticket Notification Variables

Using variables in the text makes it possible to personalize messages. Variables, known as OTRS tags, are replaced by OTRS when generating the message. Find a list of available tags stems for this resource at the bottom of both add and edit screens.

   Ticket Notification Variables

For example, the variable ``<OTRS_TICKET_TicketNumber>`` expands to the ticket number allowing a template to include something like the following.

.. code-block:: text

   Ticket#<OTRS_TICKET_TicketNumber>

This tag expands, for example to:

.. code-block:: text

   Ticket#2018101042000012
