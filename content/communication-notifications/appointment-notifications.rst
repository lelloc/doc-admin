Appointment Notifications
=========================

Missing appointments can damage your image with a customer. Once there is an appointment assigned in the calendar, it’s normal to receive notification:

- Upon a new or changed event
- Upon cancellation of an event
- Before the event, as a reminder

Notification relieves the agent the stress of mentally tracking appointments.

OTRS appointment notifications satisfies this need. Here an administrator can easily set notifications with general rules, including trigger events and filters. Afterward, appointments fitting the bill notify the correct users at the correct time.

Use this screen to add appointment notifications to the system. In a fresh OTRS installation an appointment reminder notification is already added by default. The appointment notification management screen is available in the *Appointment Notifications* module of the *Communication & Notifications* group.
