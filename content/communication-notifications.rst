Communication & Notifications
=============================

Clear, complete, and transparent communication is key to ensuring that your organization offers outstanding service to your customers. Your organization would like to give your customers the most consistent service and ensure that your service is highly recognizable, every time. Your teams want to have an identity which instills a specific sense of security and familiarity.

OTRS provides you with the tools to build teams, trust and security to better and uniformly serve your customer. With system addresses you can assign your inbound mails to certain teams and allow them all to use the same address without causing confusion by using team mailboxes via a mail client. Templates, automatic answers, and attachment management let you leverage central management of the most important communications. Many other tools are also available and covered in the sections below.
